        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p>This project was created as a part of my learning journey to better understand Git and its functionalities. During my first year of studying Java, I wanted to create a quick reference guide, that I could use while working on projects.
            It turned out to be a concise Git cheat sheet that focuses on practical, everyday commands with short explanations and copy-ready examples, and I thought it could be helpful for others as well.</p>

        <h1>How?</h1>
        <p>With some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I ended up with this cheat sheet. The design is simple and clean, making it easy to navigate and find the information you need quickly.</p>

        <h1>Who?</h1>
        <p>This project was created by Joel Seger - a first year student from Jönköping University, studying to become a Java-developer.
