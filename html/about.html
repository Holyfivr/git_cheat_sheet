        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p>This project was created as a part of my learning journey to better understand Git and its functionalities. During my first year of studying Java, I wanted to create a quick reference guide that I could use while working on projects, and I thought it would be helpful for others as well.</p>


        <h1>How?</h1>
        <p>I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this cheat sheet. The design is simple and clean, making it easy to navigate and find the information you need quickly. I also incorporated Bootstrap for responsive design and Google Fonts for better typography.</p>

        <h1>Who?</h1>
        <p>This project was created by Joel Seger.</p>
