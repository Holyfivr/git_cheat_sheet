        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p>This project was created as a part of my learning journey to better understand Git and its functionalities. During my first year of studying Java, I wanted to create a quick reference guide that I could use while working on projects, and I thought it would be helpful for others as well.</p>


        <h1>How?</h1>
        <p>I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this cheat sheet. The design is simple and clean, making it easy to navigate and find the information you need quickly. I also incorporated Bootstrap for responsive design and Google Fonts for better typography.</p>

        <h1>Who?</h1>
        <p>This project was created by Joel Seger.</p>

                    <p class="quicksand-text-regular">Welcome to the Git Cheat Sheet! This resource is designed to help you quickly find and understand essential Git commands and concepts. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this cheat sheet will serve as a handy reference for your Git workflow.</p>
                    <h2 class="kumar-one-outline">Getting Started with Git</h2>
                    <p class="quicksand-text-regular">Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects. Here are some fundamental concepts and commands to get you started:</p>
                    <ul class="quicksand-text-regular">
                        <li><strong>Repository (Repo):</strong> A repository is a storage space where your project files and their version history are kept. You can create a new repository using the command: <code>git init</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Clone:</strong> To create a local copy of a remote repository, use the command: <code>git clone [repository URL]</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Status:</strong> Check the status of your working directory and staging area with: <code>git status</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Add:</strong> Stage changes for the next commit using: <code>git add [file]</code> or <code>git add .</code> to stage all changes</li>
                        <li><strong>Commit:</strong> Save your staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message: <code>git commit -m "Your commit message"</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Push:</strong> Upload your local commits to a remote repository using: <code>git push [remote] [branch]</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Pull:</strong> Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local branch with: <code>git pull [remote] [branch]</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Branch:</strong> Create a new branch to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase: <code>git branch [branch name]</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Checkout:</strong> Switch to a different branch or restore files: <code>git checkout [branch name]</code> or <code>git checkout [file]</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Merge:</strong> Combine changes from one branch into another: <code>git merge [branch name]</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Log:</strong> View the commit history with: <code>git log</code></li>
                    </ul>
